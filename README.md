-  I am a big pro.
-  I love games, so I thought about making games.
-  I am currently learning Python idle, Web design, Violincello, Swimming, Martial arts, Public speaking and more!
-  The idle in Python is just what I use to code in python.
-  I am completely new to Web design.
-  I have been learning the cello for 3 months.
-  I have rejoined and quit swimming several times.
-  I have been learning martial arts since I was 3.
-  Public speaking is kinda boring.
-  So yea, that's a bunch of stuff about me.
